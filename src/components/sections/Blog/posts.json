      "content": "# My Journey into AI and Research\n\nEveryone‚Äôs entry into AI is different. For me, it started with curiosity about how machines could think, learn, and adapt. Over time, I explored different fields  from web development to optimization problems  and eventually found myself diving deeper into research.\n\n## First Steps\n- Playing around with basic Python ML libraries like scikit-learn.\n- Building small projects like digit recognition and text classification.\n- Participating in hackathons to test my problem-solving.\n\n## Moving Towards Research\nMy interest expanded into optimization techniques, domain adaptation, and trustworthiness of AI systems. This meant going beyond coding  I had to study theory, proofs, and experiment design.\n\n## Challenges Faced\n- Balancing coursework with research.\n- Understanding complex math behind optimization.\n- Debugging large models (often late at night üòÖ).\n\n## Why I Love It\nResearch gives me a sense of contribution  creating something that adds to knowledge, not just applying what already exists.\n\n## Looking Ahead\nI want to explore how AI can be made **reliable and interpretable**, especially in critical areas like climate prediction, healthcare, and autonomous systems.\n\n---\nThis journey is ongoing, but every project and every paper teaches me something new.",

      "content": "# Lessons Learned from Hackathons\n\nI‚Äôve been part of multiple hackathons  from ISRO‚Äôs challenges to student innovation fests. Each one left me with lessons far beyond coding.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n### 1. Ideas Matter More than Perfect Code\nJudges want to see **impactful solutions**, not just polished UIs.\n\n### 2. Teamwork is Everything\nGood collaboration can make or break a project. Learning to divide tasks effectively is a skill in itself.\n\n### 3. Time Management\nYou don‚Äôt have time to reinvent the wheel. Using existing tools, libraries, and APIs is crucial.\n\n### 4. Pitching is as Important as Building\nYou can build a great project, but if you can‚Äôt explain it well, it won‚Äôt shine.\n\n## Personal Growth\nHackathons pushed me to step outside my comfort zone, work with new people, and handle pressure in creative ways.\n\n## Why You Should Try One\nIf you‚Äôre a student or early in your career, I highly recommend hackathons. They‚Äôre crash courses in innovation, collaboration, and communication.\n\n---\nI see hackathons as mini-research labs where you can test crazy ideas fast. Every event has shaped me as both a coder and a researcher.",

      "content": "# Balancing Research and Life as a Student\n\nResearch is rewarding, but it can also be overwhelming. Between coursework, deadlines, and experiments, I‚Äôve had my share of sleepless nights. Over time, I realized balance is not a luxury  it‚Äôs essential.\n\n## What Works for Me\n\n### 1. Structured Time\nBlocking time for deep work and relaxation helps me stay consistent.\n\n### 2. Mixing Projects\nWorking on both coding-heavy projects and conceptual ones keeps things fresh.\n\n### 3. Community Matters\nBeing part of student councils, discussions, and clubs gives me a support system.\n\n### 4. Small Wins\nEvery solved bug, every figure generated for a paper feels like progress  and that motivates me.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n- Burnout is real, don‚Äôt ignore it.\n- Saying ‚Äúno‚Äù is sometimes necessary.\n- Celebrate milestones, even small ones.\n\n## Final Thought\nBalancing life and research is not about being perfect every day. It‚Äôs about being consistent, knowing when to push, and when to rest.",

      "content": "# Hackathon Survival Guide: Coffee, Chaos, and Code\n\nHackathons sound cool: 24 hours, a crazy idea, and a chance to impress judges. What people don‚Äôt tell you is that it‚Äôs basically **coding + sleep deprivation + questionable pizza**.\n\n## Essentials to Survive\n- **Coffee (or chai)**: The true hackathon sponsor.\n- **Snacks**: Chips become your best friend at 3 AM.\n- **Headphones**: Block out chaos, focus on chaos of your own code.\n\n## Phases of a Hackathon\n1. **Excitement (Hour 1)**: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to build the next Google!‚Äù\n2. **Confusion (Hour 6)**: ‚ÄúWait, what exactly are we building?‚Äù\n3. **Panic (Hour 18)**: ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt this API work?!‚Äù\n4. **Acceptance (Hour 23)**: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. Just make it demo-ready.‚Äù\n\n## Bonus Tip\nAlways have a team member who knows how to present well. Because half of hackathons = explaining your half-working code with confidence.\n\n## Conclusion\nHackathons are chaos disguised as learning, but I wouldn‚Äôt trade the experience for anything.
