  ### Accuracy
  How correctly does the data represent reality?
  
  ### Completeness
  Are there missing values or gaps in the data?
  
  ### Consistency
  Is the data consistent across different sources and time periods?
  
  ### Relevance
  How relevant is the data to the specific task at hand?
  
  ## Practical Strategies
  
  ### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  Systematic approaches to improving data quality...
  
  ### Active Learning
  Strategies for selecting the most informative data points...
  
  ### Synthetic Data Generation
